Problem - Use Linear Regression method to predict the amount of gallons required for a car that travels
1200 miles. A dataset is provided that contains the record of the distance the car has travelled in the past
and the amount of fuel required for each journey. Model a Linear Regression classifier and show the Regression Line
and the goodness of fit, as well as predict the value for the dependent variable using both, the model and Sklearn
module.

Dependencies used :

matplotlib - Used to plot the graph and show the regression line and the goodness of the fit.

pandas - Used to perform data operations and read information from the dataset.

numpy - General mathematical operations

Sklearn - To carry out operations on the data such as regression using the built-in functionalities.
